    <h2>Bugs, features and other issues</h2>

    <p>NEBA welcomes contribution of any form at any time. If want to report a bug,
    request a feature or change, just <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues">create an issue</a> - a responsible
    committer will get to it.</p>

    <h2>Contributing source code</h2>
    <p>
        If you would like to contribute code, we're looking forward to your <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/pulls">pull request</a>.
        Note: The <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/tree/develop">primary development branch is "develop"</a> (we use <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">gitflow</a>), so you might want to develop against that.</p>
    <p>
        Before we can integrate your change, we need you to sign the <a href="assets/contributing/CLA-indiv.pdf">individual contributor license agreement</a>
        and the <a href="assets/contributing/CLA-corporate.pdf">corporate license agreement</a>, if you contribute as a member of an organization. This
        is crucial to keep our stuff IP-clean - thank you!
    </p>

    <h2>Becoming a committer</h2>
    <p>
    If you have knowledge of both Spring and Sling and would like to join, you are more than welcome
    as a committer. Usually, you start of by making a couple of pull requests to show your expertise - then, the
    existing committers will vote on the decision.
    </p>

    <h2>Development quick facts</h2>
    <p>
        NEBA is written in JAVA, based on JAVA 6 for reasons of backwards compatibility. We're on <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/">GitHub</a>, and use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/unic/neba">Travis CI</a>.
        We've got a clean and well-written base of 400+ <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mockito/">Mockito</a>
        based tests covering <a href="https://coveralls.io/r/unic/neba?branch=develop"><img src="http://img.shields.io/coveralls/unic/neba/develop.svg" alt="coveralls.io status" title="Code coverage of the NEBA project" style="vertical-align: bottom"/></a>
        of the code - so we dare make changes, all the time. We are using <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git flow</a>,
        and currently, the development builds are <a href="https://travis-ci.org/unic/neba"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/unic/neba.svg?branch=develop" title="Travis CI build status" style="vertical-align: bottom" /></a>.
