    <p>The following documentation is not meant to be complete in a sense of covering every implementation detail. It strives to illustrate
    the core design ideas, as well as the most important components and processes of NEBA.</p>
    <p>The diagrams in this document are created using <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea/">Sparx systems Enterprise Architect</a>.

    <h2 class="title" id="containerview">Container view</h2>

    <p>NEBA amends Sling's open core with further open source software, which in turn is internally structured in modules. We will refer to such
    component compositions using the generic term <em>container</em>. NEBA is comprised of the following containers:</p>

    <h2 class="title" id="modules">Modules view</h2>

    <p>NEBA consists of the following modules. Each module is represented by a single OSGi bundle and a corresponding maven module.</p>

    <h2 class="title" id="corepackages">Core packages view</h2>

    <p>Each package of the core represents a semantically grouped amount of features. The following diagram shows the most important feature groups
    and illustrates the overall design approach of the core</p>

<div class="one">
    <h2 class="title" id="postprocessing">Core feature view: Application context post-processing</h2>

    <p>The most central feature of NEBA is the registration of Spring beans using the NEBA API, e.g. beans annotated with @ResourceModel, @Selftest and so forth. Here, NEBA attaches to the construction process
    of Spring application contexts. As soon as all beans are successfully created, but prior to the publication of the context, NEBA post-processes the context
    and looks up beans using NEBA API annotations or implementing NEBA API interfaces.</p>

<div class="one">
    <h2 class="title" id="modelregistration">Core feature view: Resource model registration and adapter factory provisioning</h2>

    <p>The registration of resource models and the subsequent management of the resource model metadata for mapping purposes
    account for the most valuable NEBA features. Likewise, they require a well-designed collaboration of context post-processing, metadata creation and -storage
    as well as updates of the generic resource model adapter factory. The following communication diagram illustrates the complete resource
    model registration process, from a bundle change event to the publication of the registered resource model metadata via a Sling adapter factory.</p>
