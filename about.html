        <p>
            NEBA is a lightweight and fast content-to-model mapping solution for Apache Sling and Adobe AEM&trade;, created by <a href="https://www.unic.com">Unic AG</a>, Switzerland. Since its initial creation in 2009, it has been made available

            <p>
                Key to successful Content Management Applications is a fast and comprehensible implementation of the underlying information architecture and the solution's ability to scale. As the solution matures, it must be able to bear the challenges that arise from an increasing amount of complexity and integrated systems - without degradation in terms of system quality or time spent developing solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                NEBA increases your engineers speed and ability to tackle these challenges, giving them a simple, lightweight and stable API to implement solutions based on Apache Sling or Adobe AEM&trade;. Instead of coupling engineers to custom and hard-to learn solutions, NEBA integrates well-known standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, NEBA is designed to scale in demanding environments, where high request volumes meet significant amounts of content. In addition, it ships with tooling that helps engineering understand application behavior and analyze issues quickly.

            <header><h2 id="license">License</h2></header>
            <p>
                The License model is simple: NEBA is released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Software License 2.0</a>. It is
                completely and irrevocably open source and free of charge.

            <p>
                NEBA delivers its core functionality via a flyweight kernel exclusively consisting of one API and one implementation bundle and zero thirdparty artifacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optionally, NEBA integrates the <a href="https://www.spring.io">Spring Framework</a> into
                <a href="https://sling.apache.org">Apache Sling</a> exclusively using
                <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/gemini/blueprint/">Gemini-Blueprint</a>, the reference
                implementation of the OSGi blueprint specification. NEBA provides simple annotations that allow leveraging Spring POJOs as models for resources such
                as JCR content - and transparently provides a set of solutions for common engineering tasks for Spring-Based applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                NEBA does not alter or influence the default behavior of Sling or AEM&trade; and can be transparently used from within any out of the box solution, such as Sling servlets.

            <h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
            <p>NEBA is continuously kept up-to-date and extended with regard to the latest available AEM versions. All item currently on the roadmap can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/milestone/7">roadmap milestone</a> on Github.</p>

                <header><h3>Update to Java 9+</h3></header>
                <p>
                    With the latest java version, many updates - most notably a new module system - are available. Once available for Apache Sling, NEBA will support these java versions and will
                    enable making the most out of new features of the java versions.
                </p>

                <header><h3>Continuation of the flyweight approach</h3></header>
                <p>
                    With version 5.0, NEBA switched from a mandatory integration with the Spring Framework to a lightweight kernel with an optional Spring integration.
                    As more and more advanced features are available in Apache Sling and Adobe AEM&trade; out of the box,
                    additional frameworks such as Spring become less and less necessary. Here, NEBA will continue to pursue a <em>flyweight</em> approach - being a simple and high-performance addition
                    to Apache Sling and  Adobe AEM&trade;
